To-Do App Description:

This simple and intuitive to-do application allows users to efficiently manage their daily tasks by adding, completing, and deleting tasks. Users can categorize each task (e.g., work, personal) and easily view the categorized list of tasks.

Key Features:

	•	Task Management: Users can input tasks, categorize them, and add them to the list.
	•	Task Completion: By clicking on a task, it can be marked as completed, visually distinguished with a strikethrough effect.
	•	Task Deletion: A delete button is included for each task, allowing users to remove tasks they no longer need.
	•	Local Storage: All tasks are saved to the browser’s local storage, ensuring that tasks persist even after refreshing the page or closing the browser.
	•	Add Task to Top: Newly added tasks appear at the top of the list for easier tracking of recent items.

The application is designed with a clean and minimalistic interface, making it easy for users to quickly add, view, and manage their tasks. The use of local storage ensures the app can be used offline, providing an uninterrupted experience.
